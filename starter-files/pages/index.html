        <h2 class="fun-fact-heading">Fun Fact #1</h2>
        <p class="fun-fact-text">
        <span class="title">Original Title:</span>  The movie was originally going to be called "King of the Jungle." Disney changed the title to "The Lion King" as they realized lions don't actually live in the jungle but on the savannah.
        </p>

      <div id="ff2">
        <h2 class="fun-fact-heading">Fun Fact #2</h2>
        <p class="fun-fact-text">
           <span class="title">Real-Life Inspiration:</span>  The stunning landscapes depicted in the film are inspired by Kenya's Hell's Gate National Park. A team of animators visited the park to get a real sense of Africa's environment to accurately represent it in the movie.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="fun-fact-heading">Fun Fact #3</h2>
        <p class="fun-fact-text">
           <span class="title">First Disney Animated Feature Not Based on Existing Story:</span>  "The Lion King" is the first Disney animated feature film that was a completely original story and not an adaptation of an already existing tale.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 class="fun-fact-heading">Fun Fact #4</h2>
        <p class="fun-fact-text">
           <span class="title">Pumbaa's First:</span>  Pumbaa is the first character in Disney history to fart. This might seem minor, but it broke new ground for the inclusion of bodily functions in animation aimed at children.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="ff5">
        <h2 class="fun-fact-heading">Fun Fact #5</h2>
        <p class="fun-fact-text">
           <span class="title">"Can You Feel The Love Tonight" Almost Cut:</span>  Elton John, who worked on the movie's soundtrack, insisted that the song "Can You Feel The Love Tonight" be included in the film after it was nearly cut. It went on to win the 1995 Academy Award for Best Original Song.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="fun-fact-heading">Fun Fact #6</h2>
        <p class="fun-fact-text">
           <span class="title">Celebrity Voices:</span>  The film is known for its star-studded voice cast, including James Earl Jones as Mufasa and Jeremy Irons as Scar. However, Sean Connery was initially considered for the role of Mufasa.

        <h2 class="fun-fact-heading">Fun Fact #7</h2>
        <p class="fun-fact-text">
           <span class="title">A Multi-Layered Process: </span> The iconic wildebeest stampede scene took over three years to animate. Animators used early CGI to create the wildebeests and had to ensure each one moved as an individual within the herd.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="ff8">
        <h2 class="fun-fact-heading">Fun Fact #8</h2>
        <p class="fun-fact-text">
        <span class="title">Hidden Mickeys:</span> True to Disney's tradition of hiding "Mickeys" in their films, "The Lion King" features a few. For example, one can be spotted in the dust that flies up when Simba flops down on the edge of a cliff towards the end.
